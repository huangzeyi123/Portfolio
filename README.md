The code related to the projects I worked on during my university years and my graduation thesis
一、“Children's addition, subtraction, multiplication learning algorithm”It was a simple project I designed in my freshman year due to the collaboration between my teacher and a children's education company，its function is to perform compound operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division within a thousand digits

二、“Employee Salary Information Management System”It was a project designed by my teacher in collaboration with the Student Affairs Office during my sophomore year for all staff members of the school. Its functions include (2) system functionality
1. Input various basic data. For example, entering basic employee information.
2. Modification of various basic data. That is, it is allowed to re edit and modify the entered data.
3. Insertion of various basic data. For example, inserting a new piece of information into the basic salary information.
4. Delete various basic data. For example, if an employee is transferred and their administrative information is deleted.
5. Query based on various basic data. For example, all employees with the technical title of technician and employees with a basic salary of over 4000 yuan.
6. Statistical calculations based on various basic data. For example:
(1) Count the total number of young employees under the age of 20; The number of employees aged 20 and above, but under 45 years old; Number of retired employees aged 55 and above.
(2) Calculate the total basic salary, job salary, various subsidies, and payable salary of employees with various technical titles. Then calculate the total salary of all employees in the company.
(3) Count the number of employees with various technical titles and calculate the average salary of employees with various technical titles.
(4) Calculate the total monthly and annual tax revenue of the company.
(5) Sort all employees in the company according to their salary payable.
(6) Statistics on other aspects of employee salary information.

三、"Polarization diffusion model",During my senior year, I collaborated with a team from the Electromagnetic Acoustics Research Institute at Xiamen University under the guidance of my advisor. I applied polarized images to a simple fitting model for denoising polarized images, including Gaussian noise and real-world noise. The results achieved preliminary results, removing most of the noise while preserving the vast majority of details. However, due to limitations in the dataset, I did not publish any further papers.

四、“Garage Identification Operation Management System”is my graduation project.This topic studies the realization of the garage operation management system based on matlab software. First, a simple human-computer interaction GUI interface is made. In this interface, the preprocessing, positioning, segmentation and identification of the images collected by external photography tools are realized. License plate characters are the basis of the entire garage management and operation. After completion, a series of garage operation management functions will be implemented, such as the calculation of garage parking spaces, cloud registration of vehicle parking start and end times, and self-service based on the time difference between in and out of the garage and preferential policies. Set up functions such as the hourly billing of the parking unit price, the voice broadcast of the license plate number, and the viewing of the license plate image at any time, so as to meet the basic needs of the basic operation and management of the garage.Due to file limitations, I have deleted some audio and database files. The main file is chepaishibiegui. m,  and the other. m files are auxiliary program files.
