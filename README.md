The code related to the projects I worked on during my university years and my graduation thesis
一、“Children's addition, subtraction, multiplication learning algorithm”It was a simple project I designed in my freshman year due to the collaboration between my teacher and a children's education company，its function is to perform compound operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division within a thousand digits

二、“Garage Identification Operation Management System”It was a project designed by my teacher in collaboration with the Student Affairs Office during my sophomore year for all staff members of the school. Its functions include (2) system functionality
1. Input various basic data. For example, entering basic employee information.
2. Modification of various basic data. That is, it is allowed to re edit and modify the entered data.
3. Insertion of various basic data. For example, inserting a new piece of information into the basic salary information.
4. Delete various basic data. For example, if an employee is transferred and their administrative information is deleted.
5. Query based on various basic data. For example, all employees with the technical title of technician and employees with a basic salary of over 4000 yuan.

三、"Polarization diffusion model",During my senior year, I collaborated with a team from the Electromagnetic Acoustics Research Institute at Xiamen University under the guidance of my advisor. I applied polarized images to a simple fitting model for denoising polarized images, including Gaussian noise and real-world noise. The results achieved preliminary results, removing most of the noise while preserving the vast majority of details. However, due to limitations in the dataset, I did not publish any further papers.
